# pyvideo-data-utils

Just storing some stuff I was using to contribute to [Pyvideo](https://github.com/pyvideo/data).  Placed in the `./tools` subdirectory, and run to pull data out of Youtube and the Pydata website.  This script needs some manual interventions to re-use, but it's not the worst thing in the world to get started on a pydata conference.
